 venetic_heritage_desc:0 "The Veneti are related to their Italic kin to the south, but, situated at the end of the Adriatic, have been seperated from their cousins for centuries. Taking advantage of their position at the crossroads between north, central and southern Euroupe, they have developed a strongly mercantilist culture, whilst maintaining an ancient equitarian tradition to this day."
